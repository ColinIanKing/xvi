Screen corruption when exposing a line the width of the screen

Repeat-by:

Create a long file containing one line the exact width of the screen
followed by another the width of the screen minus one character.

Scroll down until the lines are off the top of the screen.

Bring the lines back onto the screen either by moving up or by ^Y-ing.

Result:

When the "width-1" line is exposed it is intact but when the "width"
line above it is exposed the "width-1" line's final character disappears
(or is replaced by a space).  It's still there really, as shown by a
^R redraw. It's just not displayed any more.

The same effect can be seen by creating two lines of width-1 characters
then moving on to the first of them and adding a character in any way
(e.g. "Ax" or "ix"). The cursor moves to the column 0 of the second line
as it should and the last character of the 2nd line disappears.
Stranger still, if you have lots of consecutive lines of width-1 characters
and append a character to one of them, the last character disappears from
all the following consecutive lines!
