This is an experiment in keeping the issues in the source repository,
which makes more sense than keeping them separately as content on
some web service.

Following https://adriansieber.com/download-github-issues-from-command-line
we imported the issues from github using:

    http -a martinwguy -b https://api.github.com/repos/martinwguy/xvi/issues\?state=all | json -0 -a | while read -r line
    do (( count++ ))
        echo $line | js-yaml > $count.yaml
    done

using https://github.com/trentm/json and https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml
