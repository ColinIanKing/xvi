		  Keeping issues in the source tree

This is an experiment in keeping issues with the source code instead of
separately on some web server. That way, the current set of issue files
in the source tree refers to the exact version of the source code that it
accompanies *and* you don't lose them all when the company closes down
or when your mate's web server dies unexpectedly with no recent backups.

= Workflow =

The idea is to keep the description of each issue as text in a file
in the "open" directory. The file is created when the issue is discovered,
modified as its analysis proceeds and is deleted with the commit that
resolves it, often being replaced by a test case of the same name.

== Open and closed bugs ==

Open bugs are easy to see because they still have files in issues/issues and
it shouldn't be too hard to get a history of closed bugs with a script that
trawls the git history and fishes out the last versions of any files
that have been deleted from issues/open/.

An alternative would be to "git mv" them into a directory called "closed".
