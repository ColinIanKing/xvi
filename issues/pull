# Download issues from github into the local directory.

# This is an experiment in keeping the issues in the source repository,
# which makes more sense than keeping them separately as content on
# some web service.
# 
# Following https://adriansieber.com/download-github-issues-from-command-line
# we imported the issues from github:
#
#    http -a martinwguy -b https://api.github.com/repos/martinwguy/xvi/issues\?state=all | json -0 -a | while read -r line
#    do (( count++ ))
#        echo $line | js-yaml > $count.yaml
#    done
#
# using https://github.com/trentm/json and https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml
#
# Github only seems to return up to 30 issues. We fetch 30 open and 30 closed
# but it needs to fetch them all and the comments for each as well.

# Works but only gets the last 30 issues with the initial description
#
# In the yaml output, the awk script picks out
#     number: 88
# and
#     title: Fix issue #88.
# as well as uniting extended titles of the form:
#     title: >-
#       If you resize the terminal window while xvi is suspended, it doesn't notice on
#       CONT
#     user: ...
# and the shell script puts the downloaded issues into 88.yaml and so on.

# This gets us 30 open and 30 closed issues instead of 30 total.
