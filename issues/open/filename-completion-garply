Pressing tab on a partial filename gets screen update wrong

Doing filename completion on a partial filename gets the screen
update wrong. For example, ":e IN[tab]" in the xvi source directory
displays ":e INSTALL_IN" (_ is the cursor on a space)
and pressing Tab again emits further garply: ":e INSTALL_INSTALL IN" etc

The remembered command line is correct (:e INSTALL); it's only the
display that's messed up.
