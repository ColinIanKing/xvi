Interrupt and especially Interrupt-with-^Y sometimes fail 70

Occasionally, the Interrupted test and more so the Intetupr-with-^Y
tsts fail with eis status 70. Reason unknown. RUnning them again they
usually succeed.

WHen this happens, the screen is full of @ signs, one per line,
the status line reads "No File [Modified]" and the cursor is at
line 24, column 42 (!)

Try modifying the test so that the result isn't all on one line.
