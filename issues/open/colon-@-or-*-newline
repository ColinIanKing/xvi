:@ or :* of a character-based yank buffer should append newline

If you put s/a/b/ in buffer a by sitting on the s and saying "ay$
and then say :@a[Enter] it pastes :s/a/b onto the command line but
doesn't press Enter. You either have to do that yourself or add ^V^M
to the end of the buffer.

It works ok if you "ayy the command (i.e. as a line-based yank).
