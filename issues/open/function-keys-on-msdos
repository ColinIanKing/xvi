Implement function keys on MS-DOS

ibmpc_c.c maps "extended keycodes" for arrow keys and F1 ("K_HELP")
but doesn't handle F2 to F10. Their keycodes are sequential after
the one for F1/HELP.

For termcap, xvi maps F2 to F10 to #2 to #9 and #0
so we could do the same on DOS.

Unfortunately, it's tcap_scr that maps F5 to #5, and we can't do that
in dos because it only returns one character for one key.
This means adding the function keys as internal codes and decoding
them to #2 etc in edit.c and cmdmode.c
