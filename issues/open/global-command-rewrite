The g/re/p mechanism needs rewriting

The "global" mechanism can only apply a limited set of commands [dlps&~]
that it re-implements separately inside exGlobal().

What it should do is mark every matching line in some way, then apply
any command to each marked line, using the same code as is used for
: commands.

See the "if" and commentary at cmdline.c:491 which may be the place to
implement this.

When this is done, it will be much easier to do colon-@-or-*-with-line-range.
