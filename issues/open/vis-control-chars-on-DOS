Control characters display as faces and sex signs on MS-DOS

In the edit buffer and on the command line, most of characters
1 to 31 display as single characters: funny faces and symbols.

They should display as ^A, ^M and so on.

For characters with the top bit set, this behaviour is OK
because it makes accented characters work.
