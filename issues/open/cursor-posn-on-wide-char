The cursor should sit on the last character of wide chars

When the cursor is on a character that is displayed as several characters,
like , the cursor should be on the last character of the displayed version,
whereas xvi puts it on the first (on the ^ instead of the V for ^V).
The same goes for characters with the top bit set like \263.

The only one xvi gets right is the tab characters, for which it put the
cursor on the last of the space characters, as it should.
