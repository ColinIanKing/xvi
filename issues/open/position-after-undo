Cursor position after undo and undo-undo is wrong

POSIX:
"Current line:
    If lines are added or changed in the file, set to the first line added or changed.
    Set to the line before the first line deleted, if it exists.
    Set to 1 if the edit buffer is not empty.
    Set to zero.
Current column: Set to non- <blank>."

xvi differs from this:
- undoing a "%s/make/MAKE/" or "g/make/s//MAKE/" leaves the cursor at line 1
- When undoing an undo, it restores the cursor to where it was before the
  first undo.
- when deleting lines, it leaves the cursor on the line after the deleted
  text, not the one before.
