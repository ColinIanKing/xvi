Using s to delete from a wrapped line leaves the wrapped end visible
If you have:

<tab>wget https://downloads.sf.net/project/expect/Expect/5.45/expect5.45.tar.gz

displayed, with the "gz" wrapped on to a new line, sit on the tab and press s,
the tab is deleted and the line shifted left but it leaves the "gz" behind
on the following line. It diesppears when you end insert mode.

The bug doesn't happen if you delete the tab with x, or cl

The bug does happen with s and with R
