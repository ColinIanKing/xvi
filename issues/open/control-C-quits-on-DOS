Pressing Control-C on DOS kills xvi immediately

In normal mode, on the command line and in insert/replace modes.

Control-V Control-C also makes it dies immediately, so it looks like
the signal is simply not being caught.

the xvi-2.49 DOS binary doesn't do this; in command mode it echoes
^C down the left edge of the screen, and displays "Interrupted" when
you press some other key or if you wait five seconds, leaving the ^C's
down the left edge.

Test system: Compiled with Borland Turbo C 2.0 and run under dosemu.
I don't know what xvi-2.49 was compiled with.
