xvi can't run the maze-solving macros

vim and nvi can run test/1991-maze but xvi (and classic vi) can't.

One fix has been made to improve matters (a1809c3) but there is still something wrong.

The initialization ("I") works fine but the main loop

map L   QAmaGNB0M0E@m^MwX`a@mGT$B$R0M0E@m^M2WSbXGVJ0H`a@r@mU

The G does nothing in xvi; you have to press it twice, as if xvi were
waiting for a character. If you give k"nylG or kFG it goes to end of
file but if you @m, which is mapped to kF, then G, it doesn't. "n does
get its _ as it should. It turns out that the F is not mapped, which is
why it's waiting for a char.

The mapping problem was fixed by c589e31, but it stops hanoi working
so has been reverted for the 2.50 release.
