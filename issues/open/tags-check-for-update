When a tag not found, check if the tags file has been updated

If the tag file is stale and doesn't index a new function,
you can (Control-Z, make tags, fg) and repeat but it still doean't find it.

It needs to check if the tag file has been updated since we read it or, on
systems that don't have datestamps, re-read it once if a tag search fails.
