Moving in the command line with the arrow keys doesn't work on MSDOS

They just go "beep", as do Home and End. ^W and ^U work

Compiled with Borland Turbo C 2.0 under dosemu.

This also suggests adding some control keys aliases for left/right/home/end
on the command line for systems that don't have arrow keys.
