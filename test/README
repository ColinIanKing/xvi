In this directory you can "make check" to run a series of tests on ../src/xvi

You have to run it on an X display because the testsuite uses tkterm.

You can run it without an X display by going:

	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-dummy
	startx -e "./runtests>errs" -- :1 -quiet -config $PWD/xorg.conf
	grep -q FAILED errs && exit 1
	
but I don't know how you find out if the tests succeeded or not!

The test mechanism is based on Don Libes' "tkterm".
See his paper "Automation and Testing of Character-Graphic Programs".
See his book "Exploring Expect", chapter 19, p.448 onwards.
