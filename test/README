In this directory (or the one above) you can "make check" to run
a series of tests on ../src/xvi.

Each test is an executable file whose name starts with four digits and a hyphen.
Tests that begin with less than four digits are for unresolved issues and are
not run automatically by "make check".

One day the tests will be divided into sections, a thousand for POSIX tests,
a thousand for regression tests for fixed issue XXX and so on.
At present, the numbers are mostly random, with 0XXX being a regression test
for issue XXX.

The syntax of a test file is fairly horrible because the test mechanism is based
on Don Libes' "tkterm",(*) which is written in the fairly horrible language TCL,
with its bizarre string quoting rules and lame lists represented as strings.

*) See his paper "Automation and Testing of Character-Graphic Programs"
   and his book "Exploring Expect", chapter 19, p.448 onwards.

The terminal emulation has two alternative implementations:
- if X is running it uses tkterm, which uses the Tk text widget.
- if not, is uses virterm, a parallel implementation using an array.

On Debian systems, you need to
    apt-get install expect tclsh

To run it using virterm instead of tkterm, you can go:
	DISPLAY= make check
or
	TKTERM=virterm make check

You can run it using tkterm without an X display (only as root) by going:
	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-dummy
	sudo make nox

To run other vi clones against this test suite, you can use
	VI=nvi make check
or
	VI="vim -c redraw" make check
