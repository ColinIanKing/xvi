In this directory (or the one above) you can "make check" to run
a series of tests on ../src/xvi.

Each test is an executable file whose name starts with four digits and a hyphen.
One day the tests will be divided into sections, 0XXX for POSIX items,
1XXX for the regression tests for fixed issue XXX, 9XXX for non-specific tests
(hanoi, maze). At present, the numbers are mostly random.

The syntax of a test file is fairly horrible because the test mechanism is based
on Don Libes' "tkterm",(*) which is written in the fairly horrible language TCL,
with its bizarre string quoting rules, lame lists represented as strings,
needing to "sleep 1" after sending xvi a final [Escape] character for it to work
and more.
It's probably best to look at some of the existing tests and adapt them.

*) See his paper "Automation and Testing of Character-Graphic Programs"
   and his book "Exploring Expect", chapter 19, p.448 onwards.

You have to run it on an X display because tkterm uses the TK text widget.
You can run it (only as root) without an X display by going:
	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-dummy
	sudo make nox
There is also "virterm" in the "expect" distribution's "examples" folder,
a development of an earlier version of tkterm using arrays instead of
the TK text widget to avoid needing X or root, but it doesn't work yet.
