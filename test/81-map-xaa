# Issue 91, http://github.com/martinwguy/xvi/issues/91
#
# With tkterm, pending input chars prevent infinite map recursion
#
# When you say
#    :map x y
#    :map y x
#    xaa
# xvi should go into an infinite loop.
#
# If you send all three together using tkterm, the "x" is ignored
# and an "a" is added to the buffer. If you exp_send "x" and "aa" separately,
# it loops as it should.
# Using virterm it loops as it should either way.
#
# This issue may be correlated with the need to insert "sleep"s in N-tilde test.
#
# This file, 81-*, is not run as part of the test suite because
# it always fails with tkterm, the default engine.
